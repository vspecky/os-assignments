# OS Assignments
Assignments for my Operating Systems course. Wish I could implement these in Rust instead of C++ but sadly, C++ is mandatory.

## List
- CPU Scheduling: Implementation of the FCFS, SJF and RR scheduling algorithms.
- Pipe: Implementation of message passing between processes using piping in C.
- Semaphore: Simulation of a basic Semaphore (Mutex)
