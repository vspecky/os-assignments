# Demand Paging
This is a program for implementing the concept of Demand Paging using different algorithms like FCFS and LRU. Assignment for my Operating Systems course.

## Usage
Compile `main.cpp` using the Glasgow Compiler (or any other compiler of your choice) and run the binary once without any arguments. It will print out the argument instructions.
