## Input
The program takes a file as input. The file is supposed to contain 
information about the input processes. Following are the guidelines on
how to structure the input in the file :-
- One line should have one process
- Each process definition should follow the format `Process_Name, Arrival_Time, Burst_Time`
- There's no restrictions on the amount of spacing you can have between the comma-separated values
- Refer to `processes.txt` for an example

## Usage
`./binary <path/to/input/file>`
